I enjoy going on long walks/runs, reading, and listening to music. My favourite composers are Rachmaninoff, Piazzolla and Chopin.<br><br>I'm a motivated individual, and I love to work as a part of a team. I'm also proficient in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and GIS. I especially enjoy working on projects that require interdisciplinary knowledge.</p>
