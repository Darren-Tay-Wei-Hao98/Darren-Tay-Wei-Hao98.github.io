									<h2>Environment, Social and Governance ETF Optimisation</h2>

                                    <h3>Background</h3>

									<p>Current business developments through the Fourth Industrial Revolution signify yet another display of
                                        resilience by world economies and market leaders in the face of disruption. Even at the turn of the 21st
                                        Century, the world has seen major shifts in consumer preferences and societal norms directed by
                                        technological innovation. From the gift of the Internet through the Dotcom Era, to the advent of the
                                        Smartphone. Today, we grapple with rapidly unfolding technological innovation such as 5G networks,
                                        blockchain, decentralized finance alongside related global developments like the Covid-19 Recession,
                                        sustainability addressing climate change and the greater emphasis towards ethical corporate standards.</p>

                                    <h3>Business Problem & Opportunity</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        As premised, the changing business climate is followed by evolving client expectations, in this context,
                                        investors. These megatrends bring about changes in consumer expectations (Boumphrey, 2019), in
                                        which organizations must reinvent their product offerings through the rigours of constant innovation.
                                        
                                        In addition to changes in investor preferences, the development of recent events (Covid-19; Digital
                                        Transformation; Geopolitics) underpins the necessity to manage risks, particularly Strategic and Political
                                        Risks (Jones & McCaffrey, 2021). A Geostrategy in Practice Survey by Ernst & Young (Jones &
                                        McCaffrey, 2021) found that while leaders have responded to these events, the uncertainty makes for less
                                        confidence in their companies’ abilities to manage the unforeseen impact (74% before vs 55% after).
                                        
                                        As an asset manager, Blackrock’s reevaluation of strategy poses a risk to Investment Performance,
                                        because as much as investors are conscious about what their capitals are funding as Blackrock’s clients,
                                        they are also sensitive to performance and returns on their investments (Blackrock, 2020).
                                        
                                        This is where the opportunity is identified: Where demand is expected to grow in new trends on global
                                        capital flow, there exists a window of opportunity to ensnare a first mover advantage. For instance,
                                        Blackrock expects that ESG regulations, such as the European Union’s (EU) Sustainable Finance
                                        Disclosure Regulations (SFDR), would increase demand for sustainable investment products (Alves,
                                        2021). In addition, our client expects to have 70% of its products categorized as sustainable, as set out by
                                        these new regulations, in an effort to rise as a market leader in sustainable finance (Jessop, 2021).

                                    <h3>Reflection & Conclusion</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The main learning point from this project for our team is on having a clear grasp on any given business
                                        problem because that forms the basis of the objective, which the development of the solution should
                                        address at every phase. In addition, to produce a POC model within a short span of a semester, we
                                        appreciate the need for project management abilities; nuances like setting a timeline with checkpoints,
                                        delegation of responsibilities based on individual strengths and convening at internal milestones to
                                        reinstate mutual understanding of team direction. <br><br>
                                        
                                        On technicalities, the role of data and the choice of analysis methods matter, a lot. Our final output and
                                        the value we offer to the client would be dramatically different if another combination of analyses were
                                        used, which is where we turn to our project objective to keep on track. Keeping organized in solution
                                        development also had its merit - complexity in features, mistaken for functionalities in system, could
                                        derail a solution from its course and ironically contribute to inefficiencies instead. <br><br>
                                        
                                        In this vein, reverting to Occam’s Razor or First Principles kept our solution simple but effective for our
                                        client. The final product took in set inputs for set outputs, with degrees of flexibility in between, and
                                        only the most crucial of information visualized - serving as a basis for future expansion plans upon the
                                        project, for Blackrock to scale the model to assist in their strategic planning and decision-making
                                        processes to capture new opportunities. 
                                    </p>
