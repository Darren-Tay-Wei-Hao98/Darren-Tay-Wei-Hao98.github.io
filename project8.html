									<h2>Analysis of Cloud Competencies in The Job Market</h2>

                                    <h3>Background</h3>

									<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon.com, inc, is a market leader in cloud computing and was founded in 2000. AWS offers reliable and scalable cloud computing, with over 200 services to date. In the 3rd quarter of 2021, AWS controlled 32 percent of the global cloud infrastructure services market (Ref: Statista). Their biggest clients come from a wide range of domains and industries and include Netflix, Apple, LinkedIn, Shell and BMW.</p>

                                    <h3>Business Problem & Opportunity</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        With increasing data volume and adoption of technologies including cloud computing across all industries, the demand for skilled cloud professionals is continuing to increase globally. For AWS to retain their market share in the industry, they are seeking to analyze trends in jobs requiring cloud knowledge and skills across all other industries, such that they are able to stay ahead of trends and be updated with what companies seek to find in candidates. 
                                        As the tech industry evolves quickly, companies need to hire cloud talents and professionals who meet their needs, which results in evolving requirements in candidates. As such, AWS would like to better understand the specific cloud skills and qualifications companies are looking for, such that they are able to help their clients and partners like Deloitte and Accenture hire cloud talents who are a good fit. 
                                        They would also like to find out if AWS services are still highly sought among companies, as compared to other cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. 
                                        
                                    </p>
