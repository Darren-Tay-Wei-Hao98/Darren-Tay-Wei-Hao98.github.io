									<h2>Topping the Charts: A study on the factors affecting the popularity of Google Play mobile applications using clustering and classification techniques</h2>

                                    <h3>Abstract</h3>

									<p>
										What determines the popularity of a mobile application? The popularity of 816 mobile applications on
										Google Play are analysed in this study in terms of (1) the quantitative statistics and objective figures and
										(2) the qualitative factors drawn from user reviews. In this study, the popularity of a mobile application
										is defined using a score calculated using an equal weightage of the mobile application’s rating and the
										number of installs. <br><br>
										
										A range of 13 classification models, including Decision Tree, Naive Bayes,
										AdaBoost, and more, are applied to the quantitative figures, and the feature importances of each model
										is obtained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). On the other hand, Latent Dirichlet
										Allocation (LDA) and K-means clustering methods are applied on positive, negative and neutral user
										reviews, and the resulting topics are manually analysed to determine the most differentiating factors that
										contribute to mobile application popularity. <br><br>
										
										In terms of quantitative factors, it was found that category
										saturation, the number of user reviews, and the category of the mobile application are the top 3 most
										differentiating factors; whereas in qualitative factors, popular applications tend to receive more specific
										praises, while non-popular applications tend to receive more specific complaints. <br><br>
										
										This study adopts the algorithmic approach to include a broad range of data mining models, however, each model is not
										investigated in-depth to obtain the results. The definition of “popularity” may also affect the validity of
										the results.

                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                    <p>
										In recent times, the mobile application industry has surged into the forefront of technology. The global
										mobile application market size was valued at $106 billion in 2018, and is projected to skyrocket
										exponentially to $407 billion by 2026 (Borasi, 2019). This fast-growing market has captured the
										attention of businesses globally, all looking towards mobile applications as a lucrative medium to bring
										their businesses to the next level. <br><br>
										
										However, not all mobile applications are equally successful. Studies show that an average application
										loses 65% of its users within the first week, while applications that top the charts only lose about 35%
										of its users, depicting the fine line between success and failure (Sigg, 2019). Almost half of all
										applications only ever get a handful of users in its lifespan, while only 6% of applications are really
										considered successful, seeing a continuous rise in popularity. Due to the complexity of user behaviour,
										compounded by the intricacies of mobile applications, discovering the unseen attributes of successful
										applications remains to be highly demanded knowledge among mobile application developers. <br><br>
										
										In this article, we study the factors affecting the popularity of Google Play mobile applications using
										clustering and classification techniques. A two-pronged approach will be adopted throughout this study,
										splitting the research into two main research questions (RQs). <br><br>

										RQ1: What are the quantitative statistics and objective figures that affect the popularity of a mobile
										application on Google Play? <br><br>
										
										Factors in our dataset which will be used for RQ1 include the following: application category, number
										of reviews, application size, content rating, number of days before latest update, genre saturation,
										category saturation, number of characters present in application name, presence of numbers in
										application name, and presence of punctuation in application name. These factors are either predefined,
										or are calculated based on available attributes in the dataset obtained. These factors are also all
										quantitative information about the applications. Various forms of classification techniques will be
										applied on the data to determine the top 3 factors that contribute the most to the popularity and success
										of a mobile application . <br><br>
										
										RQ2: What other qualitative factors can be drawn from comparing user reviews of popular and
										non-popular applications on Google Play? <br><br>
										
										In order to balance the more quantitative approach in RQ1, RQ2 seeks to adopt more qualitative
										approaches which involve subjective factors. Sentiment analysis and other forms of natural language
										processing (NLP) will be used to gather insights on the impact of user reviews on Google Play Store of
										highly and lowly rated mobile applications. Clustering techniques will be applied on the data to
										determine the most differentiating point between popular and non-popular mobile applications.										
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                                    <p>
										Compared with conventional methods, our project takes a fresh approach to analysing the factors that
										determine the popularity of the app. We made use of both classification and clustering data mining
										techniques, utilising both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods. A range of 13 classification
										models, including Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and more were applied to the quantitative
										figures, and the feature importance of each model is analysed using SHAP, On the other hand, Latent
										Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and K-means clustering methods are applied on positive, negative and
										neutral user reviews, and the resulting topics are manually analysed to determine the most
										differentiating factors that contribute to mobile application popularity. <br><br>
										
										While many classification models were used to work on RQ1, our team acknowledges that using many
										models may lead to inaccurate conclusions as there may be a broad focus but a lack of deeper focus.
										Clustering techniques used have a limitation as well, some cluster results have high similarity with each
										other and it is difficult to be interpreted. Moreover, choosing an optimal k value for the clusters is
										subjective as well. Furthermore, the definition of “popular” applications anchors the whole study. A
										change in this definition will lead to different results.
